MKS_Folder_Structure is a program intended to allow a user to be able to create a folder structure based either a saved structure or read a directory structure from their computer.

The need for this program is based on the fact that MKS Integrity will not a user to add a folder including the empty sub-folders to the tool through the GUI. Integrity will only create the folder (which is calls projects) that have files in them. At the start of development project, there may only be a handful of files that exist but it is simpler to have the base structure for users to put files in consistent locations.

This program will follow the chosen structure and generate the command line instructions necessary to create the sub-projects (it will not add any files at this time).
